The example .tex files in these folders will create an
image which is just big enough to contain the .png
representation of the equation in question.

To use:
1. Copy a file to another folder.
2. Edit the contents to produce the desired equation.
3. Do latex <file name>.  This will produce a .dvi file.
4. Do dvipng -T tight <file.dvi>.  This will produce the
   .png file.
5. Copy/paste file as needed.

TODO: Write a script that will do all of this.  Just pass
      it a file name and let it run.
